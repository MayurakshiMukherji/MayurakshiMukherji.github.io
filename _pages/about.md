Hi! I am Mayurakshi, a Ph.D. student at the Koita Centre of Digital Heath in IIT Bombay. I am interested in AI/ML frameworks for adressing challenges in the heathcare industry. I am an electronic engineer by the virtue of my bachelor's and have 2 years of experience working in the AI/ML R&D space in speech and acoustics.
